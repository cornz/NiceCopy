## Why NiceCopy?
I‚Äôm Marlon, and I created NiceCopy because I missed the handy link-copying shortcut available in the Arc browser when using other browsers. While there is a similar extension for Safari, [Supercopy for Safari](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/supercopy-for-safari/id6477720316), which works well, I wanted the visual feedback I was accustomed to in Arc.
After reaching out to the developer of Supercopy to discuss open-sourcing it, and not receiving a response, I decided to create my own version. By open-sourcing NiceCopy, I hope others will join in to enhance its functionality.

When I started building this extension, I was new to extension development and web development in general. I‚Äôm eager to see how the community can improve NiceCopy.
